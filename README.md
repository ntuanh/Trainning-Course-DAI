Welcome to the Distributed AI Team in the FIL Research Group, ANSA Laboratory at E711-C7, Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

The primary focus of our research group is exploring optimal solutions for training distributed machine learning and deep learning models within edge-cloud computing environments and IoT systems. We also investigate the application of AI in addressing network security challenges.

-----

Our team will set up Seminars, Workshops, Coffee Talks with team members on weekends to exchange information, share knowledge and discuss project issues. üå≠‚òï

Main Teams projects can be found at: [About our Project](https://github.com/future-internet-lab/chishiki/blob/main/T%E1%BB%95ng%20quan%20chung%20v%E1%BB%81%20Distributed%20AI.md)

--------
To be able to participate in Teams projects, you will be trained in knowledge about Network, Linux & AI (machine learning, deep learning).

In addition, you will be guided on how to research scientific documents and teamwork skills.
